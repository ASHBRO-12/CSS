    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document
    written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[2] CSS is a
    cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[3]

<H2>I LOVE CSS!</H2>
<P>Because CSS is heckin’ brilliant.

Okay, I mean, no, not brilliant exactly. Actually, it’s a mess. It’s a shoddy, tottering, poorly-designed (in fact, I
hate to use the word “designed” at all; it was less “designed” than it was “thrown up”) pile of ad-hoc rubbish that
looks from a language specification perspective as if someone went through a junkyard with a bulldozer and a backhoe,
scooped up bits of flotsam at random, and bolted them together in a mess that’d make Frankenstein’s monster say “you did
what?” and then, I don’t know, probably quote Milton or something.

But once you get it, as in not the spec or the syntax (because yikes) but the use case, it’s brilliant.

The idea, put plainly, is “you can have this set of code here that controls what your site looks like, completely
separate from the site’s content, and then just by tweaking the code that controls the site’s look you can instantly
change the design and feel of the site everywhere.”

Like, define a CSS class for your headlines. Tweak just one thing and all your headlines change instantly everywhere
without needing to edit one single page of HTML content, much less all of them.

Change the CSS and instantly you can change allllll your body copy or colors or menus or headers or footers or the
graphics in your banners or your fonts or your line spacing or anything and it all happens everywhere you’ve used those
CSS classes.

No more doing a site redesign by going to every page of your site and editing all your HTML! The minute you truly
understand how much work that saves, it’s like a choir of angels descends from the heavens to sing to you personally.</P>
